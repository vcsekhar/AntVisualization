<h1>Reference</h1>
<h2>Context Menu</h2>
<p>The Ant Visualization plugin provides a context menu entry
entitled <b>Ant Visualizations</b> to the Eclipse Navigator and Java
Package Explorer views, which is visible only when a .xml file is
selected. The context menu entry has two submenus:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>Internal</b> menu entry shows the visualization of the
	selected .xml file in the Ant Visualization view.</li>
	<li>The <b>External</b> menu entry starts an arbitrary user-defined
	external program with the selected .xml file as argument (see
	Preferences section below).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>The facilities provided by the Ant Visualization plugin are
implemented using Eclipse command actions. They may be activated through
a number of mechanisms, e.g. toolbar, keyboard etc. The available
command actions are as follows:</p>
<table border="1">
	<thead>
		<tr align="center">
			<th>Toolbar</th>
			<th>Keyboard</th>
			<th>Context / Mouse</th>
			<th>Command</th>
			<th>Action Performed</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

<p>As can be seen, the method of access to commands is not fully
comprehensive and consistent, but should be acceptable in practice.</p>
<p>In the view window, Ant target nodes may be selected with the
mouse and dragged to new locations to clarify relationships. However,
their original positions will be restored in the event of a reload or
redraw action.
Note also multiple items may be selected via successive ctrl-click mouse operations.</p>
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<p>The Ant Visualization plugin has a preference page, accessible
via menu <b>Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Ant &rarr;
Visualization</b>. On that page, the program and argument syntax are
specified for the External visualization context menu entry (see above).
The token string <b>%f</b> is substituted by the selected file's fully
qualified path and filename.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
The Ant Visualization plugin uses the Eclipse GEF Zest component for the
presentation of graphical information: see
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/zest/">here</a> for further background.
